# Forage Harvester Straw Pickup
Gameplay update to ForageHarvesters Pickup headers by creating a custom `FORAGEPICKUP` _fruitTypeCategory_ to allow straw to be picked up from basegame straw-producing fields (`WHEAT BARLEY OAT`), as well as crops producing straw from the Extended Straw Crops mod (`CANOLA SORGHUM SOYBEAN SUNFLOWER CORN`)

- Customized forage harvester headers with the new _fruitTypeCategory_ `FORAGEPICKUP` have been added to the store to allow this functionality to be used - all headers are Giants assets with XML modifications.

Loading script to force-load new fruitTypes & fillTypes based off of similar code from Jos Modding, code adapted to this purpose & used with permission.

PC only due to script usage.

## Description from the ModDesc
> Adds in the ability to pickup straw from fields that generate straw from 
the crop, to all basegame forage pickup headers.
> 
> All modified headers have color selection, slight speed increase, and slight working width increase.
Since the Forage Harvester is chopping the straw, you will also get a slight 10% increase in straw.
> 
> Headers:
> - Claas PICKUP 300 +
> - Kemper 3003 +
> - John Deere Header 639 +
> - Krone EasyFlow 300 S +
> 
> Headers cost $1 more than basegame
